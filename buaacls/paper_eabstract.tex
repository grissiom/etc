In recent years there has been a great interest in the use of clusters.
Exploiting idle memory in clusters to avoid swapping and improve the performance
is taken more and more attention.

In this paper, we introduce ...

This paper describes the design and implementation of XXX, and also implements
a prototype. We tested and profiled the prototype, and found that ...

This paper first introduce previous work in related fields, then present the
design detail of our implementation. In section 5, it deals with the detailed
performance evaluation and analysis of our designs. Then, in the last section,
it draw the conclusion and state future works.
