" Fold routines for python code, version 2.0
" Last Change: 2009 Feb 2, when I had better go to bed
" Author: Jurjen Bos (foldexpr, and most of foldtext), Max Ischenko (foldtext)
" Bug fixes: Grissiom, David Froger

" Principles:
" - a def/class starts a fold
" a line with indent less than the previous def/class ends a fold
" empty lines are linked to the previous fold
" comment lines outside a def/class are never folded
" other lines outside a def/class are folded together as a group

" New idea:
" Comment lines fold with the definition if deep enough;
" shallower comments go one level up. We'll try to map this with the global comment code

" Ignore non-python files (thanks to Grissiom)
" Commented out because some python files are not recognized by Vim
