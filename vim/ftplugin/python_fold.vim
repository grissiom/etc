" Fold routines for python code, version 2.3
" Source: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2527
" Last Change: 2009 Feb 4
" Author: Jurjen Bos
" Bug fixes and comments: Grissiom, David Froger, Andrew McNabb

" Principles:
" - a def/class starts a fold
" a line with indent less than the previous def/class ends a fold
" empty lines are linked to the previous fold
" optionally, you can get empty lines between folds (see ***)
" comment lines outside a def/class are never folded
" other lines outside a def/class are folded together as a group
" Note:
" Vim 6 line numbers always take 8 columns, while vim 7 has a numberwidth variable
" you can change the 8 if you have vim 7, and use more than 8 columns

" Ignore non-python files
" Commented out because some python files are not recognized by Vim
