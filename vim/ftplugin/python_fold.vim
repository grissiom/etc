" Fold routines for python code, version 2.5
" Source: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2527
" Last Change: 2009 Feb 6
" Author: Jurjen Bos
" Bug fixes and helpful comments: Grissiom, David Froger, Andrew McNabb

" Principles:
" - a def/class starts a fold
" a line with indent less than the previous def/class ends a fold
" empty lines are linked to the previous fold
" - optionally, you can get empty lines between folds, see (***)
" - another option is to ignore non-python files see (**)
" - you can also modify the def/class check, allowing for multiline def and class definitions
" comment lines outside a def/class are never folded
" other lines outside a def/class are folded together as a group
" Note:
" Vim 6 line numbers always take 8 columns, while vim 7 has a numberwidth variable
" you can change the 8 below to &numberwidth if you have vim 7,
" this is only really useful when you plan to use more than 8 columns (i.e. never)
" Note 2:
" class definitions are supposed to ontain a colon on the same line.
" function definitions are *not* required to have a colon, to allow for multiline defs.
" I you disagree, use instead of the pattern '^\s*\(class\s.*:\|def\s\)'
" to enforce : for defs:                     '^\s*\(class\|def\)\s.*:'
" to allow multiline class definitions:      '^\s*\(class\|def\)\s'
" you'll have to do this in two places.

" (**) Ignore non-python files
" Commented out because some python files are not recognized by Vim
